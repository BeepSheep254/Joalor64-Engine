# Joalor64 Engine
My custom version of Psych Engine made with only a few changes lol.

# Features
* Cool scripts that do things.
* Watermark, Health Counter, Space to V-pose, Secret Keys, and Rank Screen!
* After you complete a song, your rank is displayed!
* After that, just press space to go back to the menu.
* Still tryna figure out how to make the freeplay and pause menu move in a disc-like motion similar to dnb lol.
* Hope you enjoy!

# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.
